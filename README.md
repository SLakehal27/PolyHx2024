# PolyHx 2024 - Pollo Vision
Have you ever wondered what bin to throw your trash to? Then this project is for you!

# Disclaimer
**The AI in this project does not come from our own model. We used OpenAI's API to be able to have image recognition features for our project.**
**As for the commit history, we had a problem in which the API key was public, so to remove it from the repo, we decided to keep it private, thus the 2 commits in this repo**

# Installation
